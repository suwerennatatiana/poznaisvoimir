    <h2>About the Author</h2>
    <p>
      My name is <span class="highlight">Tatiana Belozub</span>.  
      I write children’s books that help kids grow up gentle, curious, brave,
      and connected with the living world around them.
    </p>
    <p>
      My work is inspired by family, motherhood, real life experiences, and a deep belief:
      every child carries a natural gift — the ability to love, feel, create, and see
      beauty in simple things. Through my stories, I want to support this gift,
      not replace it with empty noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my books, children explore nature, learn to notice patterns,
      understand why every living being has value, and discover that
      harmony begins inside our hearts and families.
    </p>
    <p>
      These stories are gentle, positive, and meaningful — yet simple enough
      for young readers to understand and enjoy.

    <h2>Book Series: “Know Your World”</h2>
    <p>
      I am developing a long-term series called
      <span class="highlight">“Know Your World”</span>.
      Each book focuses on an essential element of life — Earth, Water, Trees, Animals,
      Seasons, Energy, Creativity, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first book is titled:
      <br>
      <span class="highlight">“Mother Earth — Know Your World”</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Children discover:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>why nature lives in balance,</li>
      <li>how crystals, water, trees, and animals interact,</li>
      <li>why kindness and respect are real strength,</li>
      <li>how family love makes the world feel safe and bright.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The goal is not simply to “teach facts”, but to awaken
      awareness, gratitude, responsibility, and joy.
    </p>

    <h2>My Creative Vision</h2>
    <p>
      I believe children’s literature should heal, inspire, and grow together with the child.
      Books are more than entertainment — they are gentle guides that shape worldview,
      emotional resilience, values, and empathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every story I create carries three foundations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Family:</strong> the safest place where love begins.</li>
      <li><strong>Nature:</strong> our teacher, friend, and home.</li>
      <li><strong>Meaning:</strong> every page has a purpose.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      My dream is to build a large collection of positive books that children will remember —
      and that parents will want to read together with them.
