    <p>
      My name is <span class="highlight">Tatiana Belozub</span>.
      I am a children’s author, a mother, a wife, and a person who believes that every child
      comes into this world with a natural inner light. My writing is dedicated to protecting
      that light — nurturing a child’s sensitivity, curiosity, kindness, and quiet inner strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      For many years I have been observing how the environment shapes children:
      the words adults use, the pictures children see, the rhythm of daily life, the amount of noise or silence,
      the way we speak about nature, about ourselves, and about each other.
      Step by step, I came to a simple and very personal conclusion:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Children’s books are not “just stories”. They are a subtle instrument that can either
      support a child’s soul — or overload it.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is why I chose to create stories that are gentle but not naive, calm but full of meaning,
      visually beautiful but emotionally safe, honest about life but always rooted in love and hope.
      My books are born from real questions: How can we raise children who feel connected to the Earth?
      How can we talk about responsibility without fear? How can we show that family is not a perfect picture,
      but a living space of care, learning, and growth?
    </p>

    <h2>The “Know Your World” Book Series</h2>
    <p>
      I am developing a long-term children’s book series called
      <span class="highlight">“Know Your World”</span>.
      The main idea is simple and powerful:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>To help children discover the world outside and the world inside themselves — gently,
      through family, nature, and everyday moments.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Each book in the series focuses on one fundamental aspect of life and reality:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Earth and soil as a living being,</li>
      <li>Water and its cycles, purity, and memory,</li>
      <li>Stones and crystals as keepers of time,</li>
      <li>Trees and forests as lungs and guardians of the planet,</li>
      <li>Seasons, rhythms, and natural balance,</li>
      <li>Light, warmth, and energy in everyday life,</li>
      <li>The human being as a creator, not only a consumer.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The series is designed to grow with the child. Parents can return to these stories many times,
      discovering new layers of meaning as children become older.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Book 1: “Mother Earth — Know Your World”</h2>
    <p>
      The first book in the series is
      <span class="highlight">“Mother Earth — Know Your World”</span>.
      It is a gentle, lyrical story about one family living in harmony with nature.
      The book follows them through a single, meaningful day.
    </p>
    <p>Children experience together with the family:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a bright morning and the warmth of the first sunlight,</li>
      <li>walking barefoot on the ground to feel the living Earth,</li>
      <li>visiting the garden, trees, a small pond and bridge,</li>
      <li>seeing deer and squirrels and learning to observe without disturbing,</li>
      <li>hanging bird feeders and caring for birds in difficult seasons,</li>
      <li>planting young trees and understanding that humans can create good processes,</li>
      <li>talking about rain, light, and the seven colors of the rainbow,</li>
      <li>sitting by a campfire, learning safety and responsibility,</li>
      <li>evening rituals: bathing, clean pajamas, a tidy room, a story and “sweet dreams”.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Through these scenes, children learn that nature is not separate from us,
      that balance in nature matters, that animals and birds have their own way of life,
      and that caring for the body and home is connected with inner calm and readiness for a new day.
      The book is written in simple language for young readers, but contains deeper messages for parents as well.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Themes and Values</h2>
    <p>My stories are built around a few key values that I consider essential:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Family as a living home.</strong>
        Home is not only walls and things; it is a space where children feel seen, heard, and loved.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Nature as a teacher.</strong>
        Earth, water, trees, animals, stones, crystals, wind, and light are not decorations but silent teachers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Respect and responsibility.</strong>
        Practical examples — putting out a campfire, not leaving trash, helping birds in winter —
        show responsibility without fear.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Inner and outer cleanliness.</strong>
        Cleanliness of body, clothes, and space is connected with inner lightness, order, and peace.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The child as a creator.</strong>
        Every child can plant a tree, help an animal, comfort a friend, and take care of their home.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>For Whom These Books Are Written</h2>
    <p>These books are especially close to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>parents who seek calm, deep, and meaningful stories,</li>
      <li>families who value nature, simple joys, and mindful living,</li>
      <li>educators and psychologists working with young children,</li>
      <li>children approximately 2–6 years old (and older children for re-reading and reflection).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These stories work best when read slowly — with pauses, questions, and hugs in between.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Visual Style & Creative Process</h2>
    <p>
      The visual part of my books is very important to me. I prefer soft, warm light, natural colors,
      gentle and living faces, consistent characters, and scenes that feel safe and open.
      Illustrations are created to support the text and feeling of each scene, not to compete with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I work on a book, I start with the inner message: what exactly do I want the child and the parent
      to feel and understand? I plan the family’s day as a living thread — from morning to evening —
      carefully choosing each scene so it carries both emotion and meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      For me, a children’s book is not only a product. It is a conversation, a shared experience,
      and sometimes — a gentle healing.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Future Books in the Series</h2>
    <p>
      In the future, I plan to expand the “Know Your World” series with books about:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Water — its cycles, purity, and invisible importance,</li>
      <li>Trees and forests — roots, branches, and communities of life,</li>
      <li>Stones and crystals — time, memory, structure, and beauty,</li>
      <li>Seasons — how the world changes and why cycles are natural and safe,</li>
      <li>How the world works — simple engineering and physical principles explained through stories,</li>
      <li>The inner world of the child — emotions, intuition, kindness, and creativity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each book will stay faithful to the same principles: warmth, depth, respect, and harmony with nature.
    </p>
